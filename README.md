# MOOC-Student-Engagement-Analysis

The Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) have gained popularity as flexible, accessible platforms for global learning. Platforms like HarvardX and MITx attract hundreds of thousands of learners annually. However, despite high enrollment rates, certification rates remain strikingly low. As someone who's enrolled in multiple online courses but only mananged to finish a few of them, I was curious: what actually separates the students who earn certificates from those who don't? With MOOC completion rates hovering around 2-3%, understanding these patterns could help millions of learners achieve their educational goals.

After data cleaning and imputing, I started my student engagement analysis with the data of  comprehensive dataset with Total Records: 260,838 student records across 5 different courses. The data includes student engagement metrics, demographics, and learning activity logs.
I performed exploratory data analysis both in Python and R. I then imported the data into Tableau to build dashboards, by visualizing the student certification rate worldwide in the online course platform. 

This analysis is applicable to EdTech companies and helps to identify the key features driving certification rate, providing recommendations and business solutions that are transferable to other online learning platforms such as Coursera, Khan Academy etc. 


You can go to my Tableau page for interactive dashboards, where it visualizes the [certification rate worldwide](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/leyan.li/viz/MOOC_Executive_Overview/Dashboard1#1), as well as [enrollment with student demographics](https://public.tableau.com/authoring/MOOC_Student_Engagement/Dashboard1#1) in the online learning platform.
